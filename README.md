Let's make the incremental game with the least code possible.

Needs to:
1. be able to display scientific notation.
2. be able to somehow get an autobuyer or some automation
3. Be able to save. 
4. You change the code as long as your not trolling
That's it.
Maybe you'll be able to get the size down to this README.
IDK.
